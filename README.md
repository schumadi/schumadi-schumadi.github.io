Public datasets from Airbnb contain information about

* Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
* Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
* Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

Kaggle provides these datasets for [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) and [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).

In this article I will take a closer look at the the listings data.

1. What influences the review scores?
1. What differenciates superhosts from hosts?
  * Which amneties are offered?
  * Are superhosts super-expensive?
1. What influences the superhost staus?

The datasets have a good quality, but of course some preparations are necessary to work with the data.
