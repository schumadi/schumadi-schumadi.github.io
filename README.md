![photo of airbnb host Yoshiko][hosts]

Kaggle provides public datasets from Airbnb for [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) These datasets contain information about

* Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
* Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
* Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

In this article we will take a closer look at the the listings data.

1. What influences the review scores?
1. Superhost or hosts: In what way are they different?
  * Which amneties are offered?
  * Are superhosts super-expensive?
3. What influences the superhost staus?

The datasets have a good quality, but of course some preparations were necessary to work with the data.

## What influences average review scores?
In addition to written reviews guests can rate their stay in different categories. More information about this can be found [here](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1257/star-ratings).
